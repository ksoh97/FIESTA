> **Abstract:** *Single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation (MIS) aims to generalize a model using data from only one source domain to segment data from an unseen target domain. Despite substantial advances in SDG with data augmentation, existing methods often fail to fully consider the details and uncertain areas prevalent in MIS, leading to mis-segmentation. This paper proposes a Fourier-based semantic augmentation method called FIESTA using uncertainty guidance to enhance the fundamental goals of MIS in an SDG context by manipulating the amplitude and phase components in the frequency domain. The proposed Fourier augmentative transformer addresses semantic amplitude modulation based on meaningful angular points to induce pertinent variations and harnesses the phase spectrum to ensure structural coherence. Moreover, FIESTA employs epistemic uncertainty to fine-tune the augmentation process, improving the ability of the model to adapt to diverse augmented data and concentrate on areas with higher ambiguity. Extensive experiments across three cross-domain scenarios demonstrate that FIESTA surpasses recent state-of-the-art SDG approaches in segmentation performance and significantly contributes to boosting the applicability of the model in medical imaging modalities.*

- To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first Fourier-based augmentation method that simultaneously manipulates amplitude and phase components using meaningful factors tailored to SDG for cross-domain MIS.
- We propose the FAT, providing an advanced augmentation strategy that combines masking and modulation techniques to transform the amplitude spectrum and applies filtering to refine the phase information to impose structural integrity.
- The FIESTA framework embraces an uncertainty-guided mutual augmentation strategy by applying UG to focus learning in the segmentation model on certain areas of high ambiguity or mis-segmented locations.
- Based on the quantitative and qualitative experimental results on various cross-domain scenarios (including cross-modality, cross-sequence, and cross-sites), we demonstrate the significant robustness and generalizability of FIESTA, which surpasses state-of-the-art SDG methods.
